Agreement Overview<br/>This Terms of Use (&quot;Agreement&quot;) constitutes a legally binding agreement between ViralCuts, LLC, a Limited Liability Company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (&quot;ViralCuts&quot;), and the Customer (&quot;Customer&quot;). Failure to agree to and adhere to all terms, conditions, and obligations contained herein results in the prohibition of the Customer&#x27;s use of the Services, requiring immediate discontinuation. Except for ongoing obligations, such as payment for services rendered, the relationship between Customer and ViralCuts shall cease upon termination of this Agreement.</p><p>2. Service Plans</p><p>Part-Timer: ViralCuts shall deliver up to six videos per calendar month, including two High-Fidelity and four Low-Fidelity videos. </p><p>ViralCuts retains the right to begin work on new requests within three business days.</p><p>Creator: This plan assigns a dedicated animator to the Customer. While work hours per week are not guaranteed due to potential interruptions (such as vacations, sick leaves, etc.), ViralCuts strives to provide approximately 40 hours of dedicated service per week. No fixed quantity of video deliverables per month is committed. Response time for new service items is within two business days.</p><p>Studio: Assigns two dedicated animators. Conditions of the Creator Plan apply, with concurrent work on two requests.</p><p>These Service Plans are subject to modification, enhancement, or revision at ViralCuts&#x27; sole discretion. Customers should regularly review terms for updates.</p><p>3. Cancellation and Renewal Policy<br/>Customers must cancel their service at least seven days prior to the renewal date to avoid charges for the subsequent period. Failure to cancel within this timeframe will result in non-refundable charges due to the allocation of resources, such as assigned animators.</p><p>4. Automatic Acceptance of Work<br/>Work delivered to the Customer will be deemed automatically accepted 48 hours after delivery, unless the Customer provides specific feedback or requests revisions within this timeframe. This policy is in place to facilitate the timely commencement of editing the next video, ensuring that Customers receive the highest quantity of content possible within their service plan.</p><p>5. Pricing Plans and Refund Policy<br/>Customers may cancel their subscription at any time. However, as an animator is assigned to the account at the time of creation, no refunds are offered under any circumstances. In the event of a cancellation, ViralCuts ensures that the Customer will continue to receive the service as promised until the end of the current billing cycle. Please note, there are no partial month refunds, and the cancellation will take effect from the next billing cycle following the cancellation request. </p><p>6. Intellectual Property Rights<br/>While ViralCuts retains ownership of the underlying content of the Services, including software, designs, trademarks, logos, audio, video, and general text (collectively, the “Content”) that are part of the Services, the specific works created for a Customer as part of the service (e.g., custom videos) are the property of the Customer upon full payment for the respective billing cycle. All such works are protected by copyright and assigned to the Customer, consistent with the laws and regulations of the United States, foreign jurisdictions, and international conventions. This transfer of ownership applies exclusively to completed work paid for by the Customer and does not extend to the general Content owned by ViralCuts.</p><p>7. Ownership of Materials<br/>Consistent with the Intellectual Property Rights section, while ViralCuts retains ownership of its proprietary materials and general content used in the creation process, the Customer obtains full ownership of the final, delivered project work. This includes all design and original source files created specifically for the Customer’s project. Upon full payment for the respective service, the Customer shall be the sole owner of the copyright for all completed projects. It should be noted that this transfer of ownership pertains only to the final, custom-created works and does not include ViralCuts’s underlying tools, methods, or pre-existing materials.</p><p>8. Fonts<br/>In the event that any Project incorporates fonts not owned by ViralCuts and requiring a commercial license for legal reproduction, distribution, or public display, ViralCuts will inform the Customer in writing. The Customer will need to purchase the appropriate licenses for the Third-Party Fonts. The Customer assumes all responsibility for consequences due to failure in purchasing required licenses for any Third-Party Fonts incorporated into a Project.</p><p>9. Customer Representations<br/>By using the Services, Customer represents and warrants that: Customer has the legal capacity and agrees to comply with these Terms of Use; Customer is not a minor; Customer will not access the Services through automated or non-human means; Customer will not use the Services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose; Customer’s use of the Services will not violate any applicable law or regulation.</p><p>10. Prohibited Activities<br/>Customers shall use the services provided by ViralCuts solely for lawful purposes and in accordance with the intended use of these services. Specifically, the creative content and materials produced by ViralCuts are to be used by the Customer in a manner that aligns with the agreed-upon project scope and is consistent with the terms of the service plan selected. Customers are prohibited from:</p><p>Reselling, redistributing, or otherwise exploiting the services or content created by ViralCuts for unauthorized commercial purposes.</p><p>Using the services or content created in any way that infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others, including but not limited to unauthorized reproduction, modification, or distribution.</p><p>Engaging in any activity that is illegal, fraudulent, or violates the rights of any third party.</p><p>The use of ViralCuts’ services should be in a manner that respects the integrity of the creative process and adheres to the legal and ethical standards of content creation and usage.</p><p>11. Feedback<br/>Customer acknowledges and agrees that any questions, comments, suggestions, or other feedback related to the services provided by ViralCuts (&quot;Feedback&quot;) must be communicated through designated platforms, specifically Asana or Frame. This ensures that Feedback is properly recorded and addressed. ViralCuts shall retain ownership of all Feedback and is under no obligation to keep it confidential.</p><p>ViralCuts is not liable for any oversight or failure to act on Feedback that is not shared through the aforementioned designated channels. Customers are encouraged to use these platforms for all communication regarding Feedback to ensure it is duly noted and appropriately responded to.</p><p>12. Oversight<br/>ViralCuts reserves the right to monitor the Services for violations of these Terms of Use and to take appropriate legal action against violations. ViralCuts further reserves the right to restrict or deny access to the Services or disable the Customer’s use of the Services, without notice or liability.</p><p>13. Returns and Refunds<br/>All payments made to ViralCuts for services are non-refundable. This policy is in accordance with the stipulations set forth in the &quot;Pricing Plans and Refund Policy&quot; section, where it is specified that subscriptions may be canceled at any time, but no refunds are offered, regardless of the timing of the cancellation in relation to the billing cycle. ViralCuts commits to delivering the promised services until the end of the current billing cycle, following a cancellation request. This no-refund policy ensures operational efficiency and the continued high quality of service provided to all customers.</p><p>14. Modifications to Terms of Use<br/>ViralCuts reserves the right to change, alter, modify, or remove any content on the Services at its sole discretion. ViralCuts reserves the right to modify or discontinue all or part of the Services without notice and without liability to the Customer.</p><p>15. Interruptions<br/>There may be occasions where service interruptions occur due to factors beyond our control. These may include, but are not limited to, unforeseen circumstances such as team member unavailability, technical difficulties, or external factors impacting our ability to deliver services.</p><p>In the event of such interruptions, ViralCuts shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by the Customer’s inability to receive the services during these periods. We are committed to minimizing any disruptions and will endeavor to notify Customers of any significant interruptions and resume services as promptly as possible.</p><p>16. Governing Law<br/>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p><p>17. Limitations of Liability and Indemnification<br/>ViralCuts, its directors, employees, members, contractors, or agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages, including lost profit, lost revenue, lost data, or other damages or losses, arising from Customer’s use of the Services. Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless ViralCuts from any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand due to Customer’s use of the Services.</p><p>18. Customer Data<br/>The Customer is responsible for providing all necessary data and materials required for ViralCuts to perform its services. This includes, but is not limited to, specific project requirements, content, images, or any other information relevant to the completion of the services.</p><p>While ViralCuts takes reasonable measures to safeguard the data provided by the Customer during the service process, it shall not be liable for any loss, corruption, or compromise of such data. Customers are advised to maintain backups and copies of all materials provided to ViralCuts.
